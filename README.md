# Pricing Calc Repo

This repository contains a basic React Native application located in the
`PLGPriceCalc/` folder.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) **v16** or newer.
- A working React Native environment. Follow the official
  [React Native environment setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
  instructions for your operating system before continuing.

## Getting Started

1. Install the JavaScript dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd PLGPriceCalc
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the test suite to ensure everything is working:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

3. Start the Metro bundler in one terminal:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. In a separate terminal you can launch the application. For example:

   ```bash
   # Android
   npm run android

   # iOS
   npm run ios
   ```

The generated project targets mobile platforms. Windows specific files are not
included, but Metro bundler and the tests run without them.

For more detailed instructions about modifying and running the app, see the
README inside the `PLGPriceCalc` directory.
