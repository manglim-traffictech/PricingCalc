# Pricing Calc Repo

This repository now contains a basic React Native application named **PLGPriceCalc**.

## Running the App

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed.
2. Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd PLGPriceCalc
```

3. Start Metro and run the default tests:

```bash
npm test
npm start
```

The generated project targets mobile platforms by default. Windows-specific files
could not be generated in this environment, but Metro bundler can still run.
